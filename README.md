# Aislingeach

Aislingeach is an iOS app providing access to the [Stable Horde](https://aihorde.net), a crowdsourced distributed cluster of image generation workers. In order words, you can use this app to generate art using a wide variety of open source models, all for the low price of "free", depending on how long you're willing to wait for generations to appear and how much you're able to contribute back to the horde.
